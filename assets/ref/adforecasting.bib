abstract = {Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by two neuropathological hallmarks: extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Current treatment for AD (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine) is only symptomatic and has modest benefits. Thus, the development of drugs with the potential to change the progression of the disease has been a priority. Therapies targeting amyloid Î² have been the focus for almost 30 years. However, highly promising drugs recently failed to show clinical benefits in phase III trials. Even the positive findings presented by Biogen on Aducanumab are not entirely clear and further data is necessary to confirm its validity. Therefore, researchers are turning their efforts around to tau-targeting therapies, since tau protein appears to be better correlated with the severity of cognitive decline than amyloid Î². Currently, most anti-tau agents in clinical trials are immunotherapies and they are in the early stages of clinical research. Four monoclonal antibodies anti-tau (Gosuranemab, Tilavonemab, Semorinemab and Zagotenemab) and one anti-tau vaccine (AADvac1) have reached phase II, so far. In this review, we discuss the potential disease-modifying agents tested in clinical trials and update the information of drugs that are still under clinical evaluation.}

abstract = {Alzheimerâs disease, the most common form of dementia is a neurodegenerative brain order that has currently no cure for it. Hence, early diagnosis of such disease using computer-aided systems is a subject of great importance and extensive research amongst researchers. Nowadays, deep learning or particularly convolutional neural network (CNN) is getting more attention due to its state-of-the-art performances in variety of computer vision tasks such as visual object classification, detection and segmentation. Several recent studies, that have used brain MRI scans and deep learning have shown promising results for diagnosis of Alzheimerâs disease. However, most common issue with deep learning architectures such as CNN is that they require large amount of data for training. In this paper, a mathematical model PFSECTL based on transfer learning is used in which a CNN architecture, VGG-16 trained on ImageNet dataset is used as a feature extractor for the classification task. Experimentation is performed on data collected from Alzheimerâs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The accuracy of the 3-way classification using the described method is 95.73\% for the validation set.}

abstract = {Introduction
There is a 99.6\% failure rate of clinical trials for drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, likely because Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients cannot be easily identified at early stages. This study investigated machine learning approaches to use clinical data to predict the progression of AD in future years.
Methods
Data from 1737 patients were processed using the âAll-Pairsâ technique, a novel methodology created for this study involving the comparison of all possible pairs of temporal data points for each patient. Machine learning models were trained on these processed data and evaluated using a separate testing data set (110 patients).
Results
A neural network model was effective (mAUCÂ =Â 0.866) at predicting the progression of AD, both in patients who were initially cognitively normal and in patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment.
Discussion
Such a model could be used to identify patients at early stages of AD and who are therefore good candidates for clinical trials for AD therapeutics.}

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological illness that causes cognitive impairment and has no known treatment. The premise for delivering timely therapy is the early diagnosis of AD before clinical symptoms appear. Mild cognitive impairment is an intermediate stage in which cognitively normal patients can be distinguished from those with AD. In this study, we propose a hybrid multimodal deep-learning framework consisting of a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) followed by a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN). The proposed 3D CNN captures intra-slice features from each 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volume, whereas the BRNN module identifies the inter-sequence patterns that lead to AD. This study is conducted based on longitudinal 3D MRI volumes collected over a six-months time span. We further investigate the effect of fusing MRI with cross-sectional biomarkers, such as patientsâ demographic and cognitive scores from their baseline visit. In addition, we present a novel explainability approach that helps domain experts and practitioners to understand the end output of the proposed multimodal. Extensive experiments reveal that the accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the proposed framework are 96%, 99%, 92%, and 96%, respectively. These results are based on the fusion of MRI and demographic features and indicate that the proposed framework becomes more stable when exposed to a more complete set of longitudinal data. Moreover, the explainability module provides extra support for the progression claim by more accurately identifying the brain regions that domain experts commonly report during diagnoses.}

Due to ADâs complex etiology and pathogenesis, an effective and medically practical solution is a challenging task. In this paper, we developed and evaluated two novel hybrid deep learning architectures for AD progression detection. These models are based on the fusion of multiple deep bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) models. The first architecture is an interpretable multitask regression model that predicts seven crucial cognitive scores for the patient 2.5 years after their last observations. The predicted scores are used to build an interpretable clinical decision support system based on a glass-box model. This architecture aims to explore the role of multitasking models in producing more stable, robust, and accurate results. The second architecture is a hybrid model where the deep features extracted from the BiLSTM model are used to train multiple machine learning classifiers. The two architectures were comprehensively evaluated using different time series modalities of 1371 subjects participated in the study of the Alzheimerâs disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). The extensive, real-world experimental results over ADNI data help establish the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed deep learning models.}

abstract = {Predicting Alzheimerâs disease (AD) progression is crucial for improving the management of this chronic disease. Usually, data from AD patients are multimodal and time series in nature. This study proposes a novel ensemble learning framework for AD progression incorporating heterogeneous base learners into an integrated model using the stacking technique. This framework is used to build a 4-class ensemble classifier, which predicts AD progression 2.5Â years in the future based on the multimodal time-series data. Statistical measures have been extracted from the longitudinal data to be used by the conventional machine learning models. The examined ensemble members include k-nearest neighbor, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, and multilayer perceptron. We utilize three time-series modalities and one static non-time series modality of 1371 subjects from the Alzheimerâs disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) to validate our model. Several homogeneous and heterogeneous combinations of ensemble members were implemented, and their performance compared. The balance between accuracy and diversity when selecting ensemble members was investigated. We found that both accuracy and diversity are equally critical metrics to obtain an optimal ensemble model. Furthermore, our testing showed that the proposed model achieves outstanding progression prediction performance. The proposed model achieved a high performance without using neuroimaging data, which means that the model could be implemented in low-cost healthcare environments. The proposed model has achieved superior results compared with the state-of-the-art techniques in Alzheimerâs and ensemble classifiers domains. The proposed framework can be used to implement efficient information fusion ensembles for other medical and non-medical problems.}
