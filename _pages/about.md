I am Sidong Zhang, a Ph.D student in the [Information Fusion Lab](https://www.cics.umass.edu/research/group/information-fusion-lab) at College of Information and Computer Sciences, UMass Amherst, advised by [Prof. Madalina Fiterau](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/fiterau-brostean-madalina). I am the teaching assistant of graduate level CS 651 optimization class. I also work as a research assistant currently funded by an NIH RO3 on Alzheimer's early detection. 

My primary research interests are **Computer Vision**, **Multimodal Learning**, **information theory**, and **Deep Learning in Healthcare**. I am also interested in Optimization, and currently self-learning normalizing flows and optimal transport. My primary research goal is to build interpretable mutlimdodal models based on solid math and being applicable to real-world high dimensional data, like the [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) and [UK Biobank](https://ukbiobank.ac.uk/) data I am currently working on. 

In my spare time, I love running and building gumpla models :)
