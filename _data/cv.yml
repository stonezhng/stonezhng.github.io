    - title: Longitudinal Multimodal Modeling for Alzheimer’s Early Detection in the Wild
      institution: UMass Amherst’s College of Information and Computer Sciences
      year: Sep. 2020 - present
      description: 
        - We work on datasets from ANDI and UK Biobank
        - We preprocessed MRI for latent representation features via a mutual information maximizing encoder
        - We designed training pipelines that improve validation stability and interpretability
        - Our current model forecasts Alzheimer’s 24 months in advance with an F1 score of 0.821 on a 3-label task
        - We are experimenting multimodal models fusing time series patient records with brain image features
        - We are introducing transfer learning and meta learning to build adaptive model working on multi-source datasets
        - We are researching on time series models that can precisely capture the disease transition time
        - Current result was presented in UMASS Initiative on Neurosciences Multidisciplinary Poster Conference for Neuroscience, Computer Science, and Engineering (Nov. 2021)
        - Current result was presented in the poster session in New England Computer Vision Workshop (Dec. 2022)
        - Current result is in submission to Journal of Neuroscience

    - title: "FuseBox: Stage-Adjustable Multimodal Fusion"
      institution: UMass Amherst’s College of Information and Computer Sciences
      year: Apr. 2023 - present
      description:
        - The project originated from the observation that the choice of fusion point in multimodal research matters when utilizing unimodal pretrained models, i.e. early fusion, late fusion or intermediate layers fusion
        - We work on a universal and model-agnostic approach to automatically select layers from unimodal pretrained models and compose informative fusion representations
        - We selected layers based on an approximate maximization of conditional mutual information across modalities
        - We are researching on other submodular or approximately submodular functions as approximate maximization target on selecting layers from unimodal pretrained pipelines

    - title: Multimodal Fusion for Multimedia Analysis
      institution: UMass Amherst’s College of Information and Computer Sciences & Dolby
      year: Jun. 2023 - present
      description:
        - This project is in collaboration with Dolby on multimodal speech separation
        - We worked on a multimodal dataset of video and audio, The Grid Audio-Visual Speech Corpus
        - We added a frequency based loss to identify male and female speakers besides the traditional time domain loss
        - The new loss brings an improvement of 3.25% on SDRi

    - title: "HyperFuse: Multimodal Fusion via Hypernetwork"
      institution: UMass Amherst’s College of Information and Computer Sciences
      year: Sep. 2022 - present
      description:
        - We designed a hypernet structure to add multimodal forward passing support to existing neural networks models consisting of linear layers and convolutional layers
        - The HyperFuse structure gained performance improvements on CMU-MOSEI, AV-MNIST and M3A Financial data
        - Current result is in submission to CVPR 2024

    - title: Information Bottleneck algorithm application on brain MR images
      institution: UMass Amherst’s College of Information and Computer Sciences
      year: Oct. 2019 – Apr. 2020
      description:
        - The project worked on ANDI brain MR images
        - The project experimented mutual information lower bound approach in information bottleneck algorithm with variational mutual information upper bound
        - The result was reported as my Master Thesis

    - title: Clustered Vertical Attention for Irregular Time Series Modelling Amherst, MA, USA
      institution: UMass Amherst’s College of Information and Computer Sciences
      year: Feb. 2019 - May. 2019
      description:
        - We worked on PhysioNet Challenge 2012 data set
        - We improved the prediction accuracy of the in-hospital survival of ICU patients via existing imputation methods
        - We ran Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm to determine the most correlated imputed clusters
        - We trained separate Attention models for clusters and predicted on a Long Short-term Memory Attention model
        - The model got accuracy improvements of 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.8% on 3 different imputation methods
        - Results were submitted to ICML 2019 TimeSeriesWorkshop
